# Conclusions and future work



## Future work

This work can be further developed in several interesting directions. I will outline a few possible applications and extensions, which can be based on this contribution to implement new features and obtain improvements in other programming languages or framework.

* Variants of this technique can be employed in other JVM languages to implement first-class delimited and un-delimited continuations and control operators. Languages like Clojure, JRuby, Groovy, Bigloo and others could take advantage of this work.

* The transformation described in the previous pages uses an intermediate A-normalisation pass. ANF has been related in other works to Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. It is possible to exploit the formal properties of ANF to implement compiler many optimisation available in literature.

* Actors

* Web Server

* DSU
