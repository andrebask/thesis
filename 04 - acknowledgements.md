#Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the people who made this thesis possible.

I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Matteo Pradella, for inspiring me with his course on programming languages, and then for giving me the opportunity to work on this thesis.

Special thanks are given to Per Bothner, the author and project leader of Kawa, for guiding me in the world of compiler programming. Without his help, this thesis would not have been possible.

My deepest gratitude goes to my family, for the continuous support during these years at university, and to my friends, for making this years unforgettable.
