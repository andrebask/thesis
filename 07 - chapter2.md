# State of the art

## Classical tecniques
This section describes the most used implementation strategies for first class continuations. As those implementations require to directly manipulate the stack, they are not suitable for being used on the Java Virtual Machine.

### The garbage-collection strategy

### The spaghetti strategy

### The heap strategy

### The stack strategy

### The chunked-stack strategy

### The stack/heap strategy

### The incremental stack/heap strategy

### The Hieb-Dybvig-Bruggeman strategy

## Classical tecniques on Java Virtual Machine (Heap based)
This section describes some implementation strategies that have been previously used to implement first class continuations on the Java Virtual Machine.

## Scala?

## Kilim, JavaFlow etc.

## Pettyjohn et al. technique
