First-class continuations and control operators like `call/cc` can be a tool to introduce concurrency and multi-threading features in programming languages.

The widespread diffusion of the Java technology has encouraged the birth of new programming languages on the Java Virtual Machine, languages that brings new features to the Java environment, most of which taken from the functional paradigm. Kawa is an implementation of the programming language Scheme on the Java Virtual Machine. As a Scheme it provides a functional style of programming, dynamic typing, and meta-programming facilities. However, Kawa lacks of one of the most peculiar Scheme features: First-class continuations.
